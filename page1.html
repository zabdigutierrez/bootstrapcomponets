            Nintendo <i>Plastic Playing</i> were developed in nineteen fifty-three. The development of the <i>Plastic Playing</i> cards 
            were sixty years after the Nintendo company started. Nintendo was the first company to mass produce the <i>Plastic Playing</i>
            cards in Japan. Hiroshi Yamauchi was the president of Nintendo for four years when the <i>Plastic Playing</i> milestone occurred.
            The production of the <i>Plastic Playing</i> cards took time and effort. The printing of the <i>Plastic Playing</i> cards 
            was difficult to accomplish because it was not as easy to print on plastic. The <i>Plastic Playing</i> cards were also called
            NAP which stands for Nintendo All Plastic. The <i>Plastic Playing</i> cards were a new idea playing card industry they were 
            different they were not traditional. The <i>Plastic Playing</i> cards were said to be longer lasting and sanitary compared to other cards.
            In the beginning of the <i>Plastic Playing</i> card development there were four designs of the cards. Now there are multiple 
            designs of the cards. The selling factor of the <i>Plastic Playing</i> cards was that they were washable. <i>Plastic Playing</i>
            cards were the first ever cards that were able to be washed. The <i>Plastic Playing</i> cards were more durable which meant they 
            were expensive to make. Although the price of <i>Plastic Playing</i> cards were higher in price than regular playing cards, people
            were still willing to play for the <i>Plastic Playing</i> cards because of their high quality. Nintendo also produce paper playing cards
            for a cheaper option that was aimed for children. The <i>Plastic Playing</i> cards were still preferred over the cheaper paper playing 
            cards.
