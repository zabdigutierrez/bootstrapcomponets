The <i>Famicom</i> was also known as the FamilyComputer. <i>Famicom</i> was going to be named the GameCom but the main designers wife suggested the name <i>Famicom</i> and they decided to name the game console <i>Famicam</i>. Two years after the release of the <i>Famicom</i> in Japan it was then released in October in the year eighty-five. Nintendo developed the <i>Famicom</i> to bring gaming to the household. Most people were playing video games in the arcade, so Nintendo wanted to develop something new and diverse. The design of the <i>Famicom</i> came from an invention that was also developed by Nintendo. Nintendo reused the design but gave it many new add-ons to better the development of the <i>Famicom</i>. Although the designers reused the design they still wanted 
              The <i>Famicom</i> to be unique in its design and different from other gaming consoles. When the <i>Famicom</i> was invented, it was a popular selling gaming console. <i>Famicom</i> changed the ways of gameplay and made a gateway for future inventions.
