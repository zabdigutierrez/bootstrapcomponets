            The Nintendo <i>3DS</i> is transportable game console developed by Nintendo. The Nintendo <i>3DS</i> was released in the year two 
            thousand and eleven. A few months after the release of the <i>3DS</i> in Japan it was released worldwide. One of the features of 
            the <i>3DS</i> is that it can show stereoscopic 3D effects without the need of wearing 3D glasses while using the game
            console. The Nintendo <i>3DS</i> also has features like tag modes. Two popular tag modes are the Street Pass and the Spot Pass. The <i>3DS</i>
            uses its 3D cameras and the virtual console to let the player download the games and play them like they could on older video game systems.
            When the Nintendo <i>3DS</i> first launched the rates of sales were not that great. Nintendo did many efforts to change the outcome of the selling
            rates. Nintendo decided to reduce the price of the <i>3DS</i> by eighty dollars. Even with the reduction price of the <i>3DS</i> people were not
            buying the <i>3DS</i>. Nintendo announced that with buying the <i>3DS</i> at the price it was when it first released, Nintendo would give you 
            free FamiCom games and ten free Game Boy Advance games from the Nintendo eShop. People could not refuse the offer that Nintendo had given
            so the plan to get the sales rating of the Nintendo <i>3DS</i> up worked. The plan worked well and allowed the Nintendo <i>3DS</i> to become
            a successful product of Nintendo. The Nintendo <i>3DS</i> became Nintendo's most successful transportable video game consoles in the first two 
            of release to the public. The Nintendo <i>3DS</i> was developed in new ways multiple times.
